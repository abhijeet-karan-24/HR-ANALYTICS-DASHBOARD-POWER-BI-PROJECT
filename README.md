# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD-POWER-BI-PROJECT

### objective 
TO help an organization to employee performance and improve employee retention (reduce attrition)
by creating HR Analytics dashboard.

### problem statement
Many organizations struggle with high attrition rates within their Human Resources (HR) departments, leading to increased costs associated with recruitment, training, and lost productivity. To address this challenge, there is a need for an effective HR Attrition Dashboard built on Power BI, providing actionable insights to HR managers and decision-makers.

The current lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly dashboard makes it difficult for HR personnel to identify patterns, trends, and potential causes of attrition. Without timely access to relevant data, organizations are unable to proactively address issues contributing to attrition and implement targeted retention strategies.

To mitigate attrition and improve employee retention, there is a critical need for a Power BI dashboard that aggregates and visualizes key HR metrics such as turnover rates, reasons for departure, demographic trends, performance evaluations, and employee satisfaction surveys. This dashboard should enable HR professionals to analyze data from various sources, identify patterns, predict attrition risks, and make informed decisions to optimize workforce management strategies.
